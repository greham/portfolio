# portfolio

WIP version of my one-page portfolio.
The aim is only to showcase some designs and have a small space to tell what I did and what I want.

I'll implement a Masonry.js layout for the projects, and will turn the architecture in an angular.js based portfolio so I can add project templates and case studies templates, inspired by the wonderful http://haraldurthorleifsson.com/
